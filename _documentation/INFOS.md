# Informations

Since this repository's `README.md` file is used to display informations about me on my GitHub profile, the informations about the rest of its content is here.

I like to think that this repo contains some of the things that make me be myself. I also tend to think that dotfiles are some of the things that makes us unique, so I decided to store them here.

At the moment, there are dotfiles for :
 + Bash          (`.bashrc`)
 + gSnap         (`.config/gSnap`)
 + Hypr          (`.config/hypr`)
    + Hyprland   (`.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`)
    + Hyprlock   (`.config/hypr/hyprlock.conf`)
    + Hyprpaper  (`.config/hypr/hyprpaper.conf`)
    + Hyprsunset (`.config/hypr/hyprsunset.conf`)
 + Kitty         (`.config/kitty`)
 + Neovim        (`.config/nvim`)
 + Rofi          (`.config/rofi`)
 + Sublime-Text  (`.config/sublime-text`)
 + Vim           (`.vimrc`)
 + Waybar        (`.config/waybar`)
 + Zsh           (`.zshrc`)

I also made scripts to easily import files from the home directory to this repo, and the opposite.
